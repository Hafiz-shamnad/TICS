## Features ‚ú®

Tronics offers a powerful suite of features, extending traditional version control to handle the unique demands of IoT and CAD projects.

### Version Control üìö

Our core version control capabilities are inspired by Git, providing a familiar and robust experience:

-   **Git-like Power üîß**: Full support for `commit`, `branch`, `merge`, `diff`, `log`, `stash`, `tag`, and detailed file history tracking.
-   **Diffing üîç**: Easily compare text files and staged changes between commits to understand modifications.
-   **Status Checking üìä**: Get a clear overview of staged and committed files, along with current branch details.
-   **File Restoration üîÑ**: Restore files to their state from any previous commit.

### IoT Integration üì°

Tronics brings version control to your IoT data, ensuring traceability and consistency:

-   **Device Simulation üñ•Ô∏è**: Track simulated IoT device states, such as temperature and pressure readings.
-   **Event Logging üìù**: Automatically append time-stamped IoT data to versioned files.
-   **Device Management üõ†Ô∏è**: Store critical IoT sensor data directly within your repository. (Planned expansion for MQTT integration to support real-time data streams.)

### CAD Handling üñåÔ∏è

Manage your design evolution with specialized CAD versioning:

-   **File Support üóÇÔ∏è**: Version CAD event logs (e.g., `draw_line` events), capturing the history of design operations.
-   **Event Logging üìù**: Track specific CAD operations and events in versioned files.
-   **Metadata Tracking üìä**: Store CAD-related changes and metadata in the repository. (Planned support for direct STL/STEP file versioning and diffing.)

### CLI Interface üñ±Ô∏è

Tronics provides a comprehensive command-line interface for seamless interaction:

```bash
tronics init          # Initialize a new Tronics repository
tronics add           # Stage files for the next commit
tronics commit        # Record changes to the repository
tronics log           # Display commit history
tronics status        # Show the status of your working directory and stage
tronics diff          # Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
tronics restore       # Restore files from a commit
tronics branch        # List, create, or delete branches
tronics checkout      # Switch branches or restore working tree files
tronics merge         # Join two or more development histories together
tronics history       # View history of a specific file
tronics stash         # Stash changes in a dirty working directory
tronics pop           # Apply stashed changes
tronics list-stash    # List stashed changes
tronics tag           # Create, list, delete or verify a tag object
tronics list-tags     # List all tags
tronics iot           # Simulate and add IoT data
tronics cad           # Simulate and add CAD event data
````

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Setting up Tronics is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  - A **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc`)
  - Standard **C libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `sys/stat.h`, `unistd.h`, `time.h`, `dirent.h`
  - A **POSIX-compliant system** (Linux/macOS)
  - No external dependencies are required beyond standard system libraries.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the Tronics repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/tronics.git](https://github.com/your-username/tronics.git)
cd tronics

# Compile the Tronics executable
gcc tronics.c -o tronics

# (Optional) Move the executable to a system path for easy access
sudo mv tronics /usr/local/bin/

# Initialize a Tronics repository (e.g., in a new project directory)
./tronics init myrepo
```

-----

## Usage üöÄ

Here's how to use Tronics for various common tasks:

### Initialize a Repository üèóÔ∏è

Start a new Tronics project in a directory:

```bash
./tronics init myrepo
```

This command creates a `.tronics` directory within `myrepo`, which will store all version control objects, references, stash, stage, history, tags, and configuration for your project.

### Add Files üìÑ

Stage files for your next commit:

```bash
./tronics add sensor_data.txt
```

### Commit Changes ‚úÖ

Save your staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message:

```bash
./tronics commit -m "Initial commit with sensor data"
```

### Simulate IoT Data üì°

Generate and append simulated IoT sensor data to a file:

```bash
./tronics iot
```

This command will typically append data to a designated IoT log file, like `sensor_data.txt` in your example.

### Simulate CAD Events üñåÔ∏è

Generate and append simulated CAD design events to a file:

```bash
./tronics cad
```

This will append events to a CAD log file, such as `cad_log.txt`.

### Create a Branch üåø

Create a new development branch:

```bash
./tronics branch dev
```

### View Commit History üìú

Display a chronological list of all commits in the current branch:

```bash
./tronics log
```

### Diff Files üîç

Compare the current working file with its staged version:

```bash
./tronics diff sensor_data.txt
```

### Stash Changes üìå

Temporarily save your staged changes without committing them, allowing you to switch contexts:

```bash
./tronics stash
```

### Tag a Commit üè∑Ô∏è

Create a lightweight tag to mark significant points in your project history:

```bash
./tronics tag v1.0
```

### View Status üìä

Check the status of your working directory, including staged and committed files, and the current branch:

```bash
./tronics status
```

-----

## Example Workflow üõ†Ô∏è

Let's walk through a complete Tronics workflow demonstrating its capabilities:

```bash
# Initialize a new Tronics repository
./tronics init testrepo
cd testrepo

# Create a file, add it, and commit
echo "sensor: active" > sensor_data.txt
../tronics add sensor_data.txt
../tronics commit -m "Initial sensor data"

# Simulate IoT and CAD data events
../tronics iot
../tronics cad

# Create a new branch and switch to it for development
../tronics branch dev
../tronics checkout dev

# Make changes, stage them, stash, and then pop the stash
echo "sensor: updated" >> sensor_data.txt
../tronics add sensor_data.txt
../tronics stash # Saves the 'sensor: updated' change
../tronics pop    # Applies the stashed change back

# Commit the updated sensor data
../tronics commit -m "Updated sensor data"

# View the history of the sensor_data.txt file
../tronics history sensor_data.txt

# Switch back to the main branch
../tronics checkout main

# Merge the changes from the 'dev' branch into 'main'
../tronics merge dev

# Tag a significant release version
../tronics tag v1.0
```
